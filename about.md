## Big Stick Ideology

U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt made famous the old proverb:

"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far."

While its origins are debated, the essence of this phrase, as applied to foreign policy, is to negotiate peacefully and respectfully, but to have the capability of irrefutable force should it be needed. Importantly, the force is there but *ideally not used*. It's really the the flip side withe same meaning of perhaps a more common saying in the dev world:

"With great power comes great responsibility."

## Big Stick Coding

This philosophy translates very well into code development. Brute force code is always an option. Whether its brute force algorithms, copy-pasting the dependency's code that you can't seem to import without issue into a python script, or opening up a core Ruby class to modify it's `to_s` function, sometimes the hulk smash solution is the right pick for the task at hand.

But far more satisfying, far more maintainable, and far more far preferable for so many more reasons, is to code with respect and finesse. Construct the right architecture. Encapsulate the right concepts in your classes. Define methods and functions that are just the right amount of code with just the right amount of responsibility.

In reality, of course, there's not such thing as "just the right" anything in code. And yet we all know when we've clicked into something that feels like it's just right. And that's what I'm going for. In this blog, there are some posts that try to really construct an elegant understanding of how some code works and how other code could be designed.

But carry a big stick. Know how to wield it. So other posts (and sometimes the same posts) in this blog will do some stupid things, like opening up `ActiveRecord`, a core Ruby on Rails class, to inject functionality that I think is cool or even necessary. Now, I wouldn't *actually* suggest doing this in production code, although I can neither confirm nor deny having actually done so. But in any case, the exploration is enlightening!

## Misc

What's with the dog? Well, apart from carrying a big stick, my dog, Kobe, actually does speak softly. In fact, it was very difficult to train him to bark on cue, but now he does but it's usually a whisper. They say dogs emulate their owners. Well, what can I say, I guess we get it from each other.
